# 3_Card_Poker
This game can be run on any Windows computer by simply downloading and starting 3_Card_Poker.exe. The executable's code can be viewed by opening the folder "FinalProject" with the [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

While one can click individual buttons on the GUI, the focus changes between buttons as the game progresses, so that one can play by merely pressing "Enter" between phases.

A game of 3 Card Poker, written in Visual Basic. I completed this project in spring 2018.
